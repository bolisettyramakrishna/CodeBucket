Notes to remember: For basic programming
%c character
%d decimal
%x hexadecimal
range of unsigned int is from 0 to 65535, when we increment it, it will become zero and after another increment it will be 1 and so on so forth.
In an array x[5]=5[X]
any value with 0x prefix is hexadecimal notation ie. 0x10 (10 of hexadecimal is equal to 16 in decimal)
any value with 0 prefix is octal notation ie. 010 (10 of octal is equal to 8 in decimal)
sizeof(x) means size of the datatype(if the datatype is a string then we include the spaces and if the datatype is char array then we include the null character at last too).
strlen() function is used to find the length of the string.
sizeof(pointer) is 2 bytes.
characters
